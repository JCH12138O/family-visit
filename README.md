# Family visit research for Chinese students<br/>
Most of Chinese students during their graduation ceremony are facing a problem -- Their family (mostly parents) would like to attend the ceremony, but they usually face some incapable problems:<br/>
1) Complex international travel related tasks in a foreign language<br/>
2) Housing<br/>
3) Tour route selection<br/>
4) Transportation<br/>
5) Students love to give their parents a comfortable travel experience, but they are inexperienced or too busy for it.<br/>

Based on that, I developed a research survey to understand their need and potential in this market.<br/>
